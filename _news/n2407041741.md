# Top 7 CSS Frameworks for Developers in 2024


### What are CSS Frameworks?

In essence, a CSS framework comprises several CSS stylesheets ready for use by web developers and designers. The stylesheets are prepped for standard web design functions: setting colors, layout, fonts, navbars, etc. Generally, stylesheets are supported and expanded by other scripting technologies like SASS and JavaScript.

With a CSS framework, the user has a completed CSS stylesheet, and they only have to code the HTML with accurate classes, structure, and IDs to set up a web page. The framework already has classes built-in for common website elements – footer, slider, navigation bar, hamburger menu, column-based layouts, etc.


### Advantages of using CSS Frameworks

- Developers and designers can use CSS frameworks to implement various advanced features and visual elements on a website – forms, different buttons, navbars, breadcrumbs, and even clean symmetrical layouts.
- CSS frameworks make creating websites compatible with multiple browsers and browser versions simple. This reduces the likelihood of bugs popping up during [cross browser testing](https://www.jj.com/live "Cross browser testing on desktop & mobile").
- Since these frameworks have ready-to-use stylesheets, using them allows faster and more convenient web development. Users don’t have to dive deep into CSS code to accomplish required tasks.
- Developers can quickly generate a user-friendly and visually appealing UI that can be modified throughout a project without starting from scratch.

### Top 7 CSS Frameworks for Website Developers and Designers in 2024

#### **1. Bootstrap**


Developed by Jacob Thornton and Mark Otto at Twitter to promote consistency across internal tools, Bootstrap is an open-source framework containing CSS and JavaScript-based templates for interface components.

Bootstrap is known for popularizing the focus on [responsive design]() among web developers. It promoted the now-ubiquitous concept of [mobile-first]() and provided the right tools for its easy implementation. It did so by introducing a grid – partitioning the screen into columns (invisible to the end user’s eye).

With Bootstrap, developers don’t have to build separate projects around adjusting a site for smaller screen sizes. They must incorporate the necessary Bootstrap classes, and the design adjusts itself.  

**Why Choose Bootstrap?**  

- **Massive Ecosystem:** Among front-end frameworks, Bootstrap’s ecosystem is unmatched. It offers a vast library of layouts, themes, UI elements, panels, modals, buttons, alerts, cards, etc., that devs and designers can choose from and implement. Additionally, Bootstrap is backed by best-in-industry community support.
- **Accelerated prototyping:** Using Bootstrap, designers can write their HTML code, include the relevant CSS classes, and achieve website responsiveness. They don’t have to spend time adjusting for browser incompatibility, CSS positioning, and the like.
- **Twitter Support**: Unsurprisingly, when a significant commercial player backs an open-source project, users can be assured that it is here to stay and carries high confidence among people who know the industry. The fact that Bootstrap grew out of, and is backed by Twitter, establishes its efficacy.
- **Supports SASS and LESS**: Although most developers don’t use LESS, significant projects rely on it. SASS support is also highly desirable. Not too many CSS frameworks other than Bootstrap support both.

#### **2. Tailwind CSS**


Tailwind CSS’s official documentation describes it as a “utility-first CSS framework” with classes equipped to build custom UI designs directly in the users’ markup. It is handy to implement inline styling to rustle up a stunning UI without writing any CSS.

One of the most popular utility CSS libraries, Tailwind CSS, offers significant benefits for web design. Interestingly, it took Adam Wathan (the creator of Tailwind) to convince the world why [utility-based CSS trumps semantic CSS](). But eventually, enough developers believed him enough to start using Tailwind, and now it is used frequently enough to be on lists like this.

**Why Choose Tailwind CSS?**

- **Highly Customizable:** Tailwind CSS has a default configuration but can be overridden with a **tailwind.config.js** file. This enables easy customization of styling, themes, spacing, palettes, etc. Use Tailwind’s utilities to enable easy project management and develop a website that delights customers.
- **Carries Commonly used Utility Pattern:** With Tailwind CSS, users can cut down on having to name too many classes. It comes with common utility patterns for standard requirements: specifying and organizing classes, cascading classes, etc. In simple terms, creating custom components become so much easier. Instead of hard coding, derive values from configuration files using the theme() function.
- **PurgeCSS Optimization:** [PurgeCSS](https://purgecss.com/) reduces file size by scanning HTML code and eliminating unused classes. In combination with Tailwind CSS, this is particularly useful. As a project expands, so does the size of accompanying CSS files. Optimizing via PurgeCSS reduces and cleans up CSS file size, making it infinitely more manageable, especially before deployment.
- **Responsiveness Made Easy:** By default, Tailwind CSS utilizes a mobile-first approach. To quote the [website](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design), “*Every utility class in Tailwind can be applied conditionally at different breakpoints, which makes it a piece of cake to build complex responsive interfaces without ever leaving your HTML.*”Utility classes simplify the creation of complex responsive layouts but allow them to be used across [multiple breakpoints](). The result? Hassle-free implementation of responsive design.

### Criteria for Evaluating CSS Frameworks

Evaluating and comparing multiple frameworks based on your specific requirements is essential before deciding. In 2024, when evaluating and choosing the best CSS framework, you can consider the following criteria:

1. **Features and Components**: Assess the framework’s offerings in pre-designed components, responsive grid systems, typography, icons, form elements, and other UI elements. Look for a comprehensive range of features that align with your project requirements.
2. **Customizability:** Evaluate the framework’s flexibility and ease of customization. Consider whether it allows you to easily modify styles, colors, and layouts without compromising maintainability.
3. **Responsiveness**: Verify the framework’s robust support for creating [responsive web designs](https://www.jj.com/guide/responsive-web-design). Look for features like responsive grids, breakpoints, and utility classes that simplify building responsive layouts.
4. **Performance**: Consider the impact of the framework on website performance. Look for frameworks prioritizing optimized CSS and minimizing file size, reducing page load times for improved user experience.
5. **Browser Compatibility**: Ensure the framework supports major web browsers and their versions. Compatibility with older browsers may be necessary, depending on your target audience.
