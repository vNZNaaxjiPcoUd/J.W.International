Artificial intelligence, what can it do for us?

Often, there are many times when you just want someone to help you. For example, it can help you regulate the temperature in your home so you feel comfortable when you return home. Help keep an eye on the children in the yard and stop them if they run wild. Help collect packages. Something to wait for.

It's very convenient if someone can help in these situations, but it would be even better if there was a machine that could do it. We have begun researching the integration of artificial intelligence and home automation and providing solutions. If you are interested, you can explore with us.
